# This Notepad is to see the basics of Django

// Usually we install Django in an virtual env and so we need to create a virtual env 
	to do so we give the command python -m venv venv_name

// To install Django we can give 			pip install django

// To view the version of Django we can give		python -m django --version

// To see all the list of sub command we can give 	django-admin

// To create a new project we can give 			django-admin startproject project_name

// To start up the server we can give 			python manage.py runserver

// To create an app for our django app we can give 	python manage.py startapp blog

// views.py is inside the app dir which we need
	httpresponse that is used to give router	from django.http import HttpResponse

// This vews folder are just the logics and we map 
	the views with the urls.py which is similar
	to the django app urls.py file			from . import views

// Also to make this work we need to add the urls
	from the blog with the django urls,
	to do so we need include the url path
	by importing include from django.urls
	in the django urls.py				path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))

// This will chop of the string 'blog' and send
	the other value in strings			

// now it goes to the blog.urls.py and checks the
	pattern from urlpattern and checks for path	path('', views.home, name='blog-home')

// Now it takes us to the views dir and sees for
	home function which does the work		def home(request):
								return HttpResponse(<h1>HI</h1>)
