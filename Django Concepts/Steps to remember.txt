Django-admin startproject project_name
// to start an django project

py manage.py startapp app_name
or
django-admin startapp app_name
// to start an django app

After creating the app you must include it in the setting of project
appname.apps.AppnameConfig

After that you need to add the url pattern in the project
path('', include('app_name.urls'))

In the url you must import the views file

After that you should give app_name and the urlpattern=[]
app_name= 'app_name'
urlpatterns = [
path('',views.fun_name, args)
]

In the view.py file define a func with request argument

to render an file we need template folder 

render takes two minimum args and three args max
render(request, 'appname/template_name.html')
render(request, 'appname/template_name.html',{dict_key:dict_value})

We also have an base html template that can be imported in other html 
to do we use the {% block content %} {% endblock %}
{% extends 'dir/base.html'%}

To add static files we need to give
{% load static %}

We also can use the url tag to not hardcode the url inside the rendering files
we can do this by simply giving them the {% url 'url-name' %}


Models is the main file which is used to create the database table
we define it in the app files with inheritance of models.Model
calling all the variable with model.Field_name()

To use this in the views we must import the models in the view directory

We should declare the model in the admin page to use it in the admin page
to do so we simply import and give
admin.site.register(model_name)

To give this data from the data base we must write the objects code in the views file

content = comment.objects.all()

and this connect can be given to the render as third args
